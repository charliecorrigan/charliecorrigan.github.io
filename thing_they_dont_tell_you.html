				<p>My first six weeks at Turing have been an intensive crash course in programming fundamentals. I&apos;ve formed a solid foundation in general programming skills and started to become comfortable in Ruby specifically.  But, I&apos;m also learning <em>what it&apos;s like to be able to program a machine. </em>It's absolutely wonderous.</p><br>

        <p>Because I don&apos;t have a very traditional background for a software engineer, I can&apos;t help but feel like a spy that&apos;s been sent into foreign territory with an obligation to report back to my fellow liberal arts and English majors what programming is <em>really</em> like.</p><br>

        <p><em>&quot;&apos;Harry - yer a wizard.&apos;<br> 
        &apos;I&apos;m a what?&apos; gasped Harry.&quot;</em><br>- JK Rowling, <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&apos;s Stone</em></p><br>

        <p>Here&apos;s the big secret that no one told me as I was reading fantasy novels and building worlds with paint as liberal arts major: Programming is our world&apos;s wizardry. You learn to speak a new language that can communicate with a non-human source of power, and you draw on that source of power to make interesting and powerful things happen in the world around you.</p><br>

        <p>I am learning to be a mother fucking wizard. And it is everything I dreamed it might be.</p><br>
