        <p>In Programming, much like in Creative Writing, Music, and Art, there&apos;s no one right answer. There&apos;s technique, and skill, there&apos;s truth and destination, there&apos;s convention in style, but there&apos;s no single path. You create your own path. Your code is your own composition. And as in any other language, one first gains functionality, then fluency, then eloquence...</p>

				<p>If you&apos;ve known me for a long time, you might be surprised to see me pen a blog about computer programming. If you don&apos;t already know me, you might be surprised to learn I come from a life of painting and book slingin&apos;. Either way, a good place to start this endeavor might be to explain how I got myself into this...</p>
