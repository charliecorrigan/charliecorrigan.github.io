          <p>In programming, much like in creative writing, music, and art, there&apos;s no one right answer. There&apos;s technique and skill, there&apos;s truth and destination, there&apos;s convention in style; but, there&apos;s no single path. Your code is your own composition. And as in any other language, one first gains functionality, then fluency, then eloquence.</p><br>

          <p><em>&quot;For sale: baby shoes, never worn.&quot;</em></p><br>

          <p>The general perception is that the shortest code is the best code. Even within the first week, our classroom chat channel erupted into a friendly competition to see who could get their solution for SuperFizzBuzz (a classic and common beginner coding exercise) into the fewest lines*. But brevity is not all.</p><br>

          <p>Ruby programming values concision, but in a <em>Hemingway-esque</em> sense. It&apos;s <em>eloquent</em> brevity they&apos;re after. Those lines of code have to convey clear meaning to both human and machine. Programmers often have this duel audience and good Ruby programmers don&apos;t neglect either.</p><br>

          <p>If you&apos;re new to coding and searching on Stack Overflow for a clear, easy-to-read answer and instead being given a single line response stuffed full of garbled colons, curly brackets, and four cryptic abbreviations, please take this opportunity to feel vindicated in your frustrations. Ruby is supposed to be easy to read. Sure, you&apos;ll get better at deciphering other people&apos;s solutions with time, but the person answering your question might also be neglecting to compose their Ruby in the readable, accessible way it was meant to be.</p><br>

          <p>*I came up with the second shortest SuperFizzBuzz in the group: eight lines.</p><br>
