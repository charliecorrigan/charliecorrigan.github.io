				<p>If you&apos;ve known me for a long time, you might be surprised to see me pen a blog about computer programming. If you don&apos;t already know me, you might be surprised to learn I come from a life of painting and book slingin&apos;. Either way, a good place to start this endeavor might be to explain how I got myself into this.</p><br>

        <p>Last winter, one of the teens I knew at the library fled her abusive home. She  was in her senior year of high school and stayed with me and my husband for the six months before graduation. While she lived with us, we spent a lot of time talking about the future and what she might do after high school. She hoped for a job that would allow her to be independent of her abusive family and didn't require her to spend what seemed to her like a lifetime in college. Computer Science made the shortlist and she signed up for an intro class at her high school. In order to help her with her homework, I began working through the Odin Project online. Within the first month of the semester, my foster daughter had already decided that a career in computers wasn&apos;t for her and she dropped out of her Computer Science class. But, in those same first few weeks of January, I had learned just enough to know that I wanted to know more. But, I was getting overwhelmed by the mass of free information online.</p><br>

        <p>In spring, I signed up for an Introduction to Programming: Python class at Red Rocks Community College to give me a more focused introduction. Within the first week of class, my world shifted. I already had what I thought was my dream job. The library was my career, I loved it, I was good at it, it was my home and a huge part of my identity. And yet by the end of my second night class at a community college, I was questioning the entire narrative of my life up until that moment. I wasn&apos;t yet a good or experienced programmer, but I knew beyond a doubt that I was supposed to be a programmer.</p><br>

        <p>By the end of the summer I began to realize that I didn&apos;t want to meander through a part-time community college education. I wanted to throw myself into this. I wanted to become a programmer. And so, I tearfully said farewell-for-now to both the library and my art shop, and I knocked on Turing&apos;s door to ask for a seat.</p><br>
